# ü§ñ Claude Code Guide: API to MonetizedMCP Conversion

**Use Claude Code's AI capabilities to transform any REST API into a monetized service for AI agents.**

## üéØ Overview

Claude Code excels at understanding API documentation and generating clean, production-ready MonetizedMCP servers. This guide shows you how to leverage Claude's strengths for maximum success.

## üöÄ Quick Start with Claude Code

### Step 1: Project Setup

```bash
# Clone the starter template
git clone https://github.com/MonetizedMCP/starter-kit-template
cd starter-kit-template

# Open in your preferred editor (VS Code, etc.)
code .
```

### Step 2: Claude Code Conversation Pattern

**Start with this structured approach:**

```
I want to convert [API_NAME] into a MonetizedMCP server. Here's what I need help with:

1. **API Analysis**: Please analyze this API documentation: [API_DOCS_URL]
2. **Monetization Strategy**: Suggest pricing for each endpoint based on complexity and value
3. **Implementation**: Generate the MonetizedMCP server code following this template structure

Please examine the starter template first, especially:
- src/server/server.ts (main server class)
- src/server/purchasableItems.ts (service definitions)
- src/server/paymentMethods.ts (payment configuration)

Let's start with the analysis phase.
```

### Step 3: Iterative Development with Claude

Claude Code works best with iterative refinement:

**Phase 1 - Analysis**
```
Based on [API_DOCS_URL], identify:
1. The 5-10 most valuable endpoints for AI agents
2. Authentication requirements
3. Rate limits and constraints  
4. Suggested pricing strategy

Present this as a structured plan before we code.
```

**Phase 2 - Core Implementation**  
```
Now implement the MonetizedMCP server with:
1. purchasableItems.ts with the endpoints we identified
2. Update server.ts with the API integration logic
3. Handle authentication and error cases
4. Follow the existing code patterns in the template
```

**Phase 3 - Refinement**
```
Let's optimize the implementation:
1. Improve error handling and user messages
2. Add input validation for parameters
3. Optimize pricing based on computational cost
4. Add usage examples for each service
```

## üéØ Claude Code Strengths

### Excellent API Documentation Analysis
Claude Code excels at reading complex API docs and extracting key information:

```
Please analyze this API documentation and create a comprehensive service mapping:
[API_DOCS_URL]

For each endpoint, provide:
- Endpoint purpose and agent use cases
- Required parameters and their types
- Expected response format
- Suggested pricing ($0.01-$1.00+ range)
- Implementation complexity (1-5 scale)

Focus on endpoints that would be most valuable for AI agents.
```

### Strong Code Architecture Understanding
Claude understands the MonetizedMCP pattern well:

```
I have this existing MonetizedMCP template. Please extend it to support [API_NAME] while maintaining the same architectural patterns:

1. Keep the same class structure in server.ts
2. Follow the purchasableItems pattern for service definitions  
3. Maintain consistent error handling approaches
4. Use the same environment variable patterns

Show me the key files that need changes and their implementations.
```

### Great at Incremental Improvements
Claude excels at refining and optimizing existing code:

```
Here's my current implementation [paste code]. Please improve it:

1. **Error Handling**: Add better error messages for common API failures
2. **Validation**: Add input validation for all parameters  
3. **Pricing**: Optimize pricing based on API costs and agent value
4. **Documentation**: Add clear descriptions for agent discovery

Make minimal changes while maximizing value.
```

## üìù Proven Claude Code Patterns

### Pattern 1: Documentation-First Approach
```
Phase 1: "Analyze [API_DOCS] and create a service specification"
Phase 2: "Implement the specification as MonetizedMCP code"  
Phase 3: "Test and refine the implementation"
```

### Pattern 2: Example-Driven Development
```
Here's a working MonetizedMCP server for weather data [paste example]. 
Please create a similar server for [YOUR_API] following the exact same patterns but adapted for [YOUR_API]'s specific endpoints and authentication.
```

### Pattern 3: Problem-Solution Framework
```
Problem: I need to monetize this API [API_DOCS] for AI agents
Context: Using MonetizedMCP framework with this template [repo link]
Goal: Generate $50-200/month from agent usage
Constraints: Keep pricing competitive, handle rate limits

Please provide a complete solution with implementation details.
```

## üîß Advanced Claude Code Techniques

### Multi-Step Complex APIs
For complex APIs, break down the conversation:

```
Step 1: "Let's start with authentication - how should I handle [API_AUTH_TYPE] in MonetizedMCP?"

Step 2: "Now implement the 3 most important endpoints: [list endpoints]"

Step 3: "Add error handling for common failure scenarios"

Step 4: "Optimize for agent usage patterns and pricing"
```

### Existing Code Integration
```
I have this existing API client code [paste code]. Please convert it into a MonetizedMCP server by:

1. Wrapping existing functions in MonetizedMCP purchase handlers
2. Adding appropriate pricing for each function
3. Converting parameters to MonetizedMCP format
4. Adding payment verification

Maintain all existing functionality while adding monetization.
```

### Competitive Analysis Approach
```
I want to monetize [API_TYPE] services. Research what similar services charge and suggest competitive pricing for:

[List your API endpoints]

Consider factors like:
- Computational cost
- Data freshness/quality  
- Agent usage frequency
- Alternative options available

Provide pricing strategy with rationale.
```

## üß™ Testing with Claude Code

### Validation Approach
```
Here's my MonetizedMCP implementation [paste code]. Please:

1. **Code Review**: Check against MonetizedMCP best practices
2. **Security Check**: Validate environment variable handling
3. **Error Scenarios**: Identify potential failure points
4. **Agent UX**: Evaluate from an AI agent's perspective
5. **Test Cases**: Suggest test scenarios to validate functionality

Provide a comprehensive assessment with improvement suggestions.
```

### Performance Optimization
```
My MonetizedMCP server works but I want to optimize it for:

1. **High volume usage** (100+ requests/hour)
2. **Low latency** (sub-500ms response times)
3. **Cost efficiency** (maximize profit margins)
4. **Agent satisfaction** (clear error messages, reliable service)

Please analyze my code and suggest optimizations.
```

## üö® Common Claude Code Gotchas

### Issue: Claude suggests overly complex implementations
**Solution**: Guide towards simplicity
```
Keep the implementation simple and follow the existing template patterns exactly. 
Don't add unnecessary abstractions - prioritize working code over perfect architecture.
```

### Issue: Pricing suggestions are too conservative
**Solution**: Provide market context
```
AI agents are willing to pay premium for convenience and reliability. 
Weather data agents regularly pay $0.05+ per query. Price accordingly.
```

### Issue: Missing authentication handling
**Solution**: Be explicit about auth requirements
```
This API requires [AUTH_TYPE]. Please implement proper authentication handling 
including token refresh, error handling for auth failures, and secure credential storage.
```

## üéØ Best Practices with Claude Code

### 1. **Start with Clear Requirements**
```
I need a MonetizedMCP server for [API_NAME] that:
- Generates $X per month in revenue
- Handles Y requests per hour
- Costs less than $Z per request to operate
- Provides [specific agent use cases]
```

### 2. **Provide Context and Examples**
Always share relevant examples and templates:
```
Here's how authentication works in our template [paste code].
Please implement similar authentication for [YOUR_API].
```

### 3. **Iterate in Small Steps**
Claude works best with focused requests:
```
Let's focus just on the core API integration first. 
We'll add advanced features like caching and rate limiting in the next step.
```

### 4. **Validate Understanding**
```
Before you implement, please confirm your understanding:
1. Which endpoints will you include?
2. What pricing strategy will you use?
3. How will you handle authentication?
4. What error scenarios will you cover?
```
