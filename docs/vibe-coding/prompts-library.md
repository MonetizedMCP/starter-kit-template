# üìù Vibe Coding Prompts Library

**Copy-paste ready prompts for converting popular APIs into MonetizedMCP servers using AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)**

## üéØ Universal Base Prompt

**Use this as the foundation for any API conversion:**

```
Convert [API_DOCUMENTATION_URL] into a MonetizedMCP server using this repo as a reference: https://github.com/MonetizedMCP/starter-kit-template.

Start by reading the README. Then, examine how src/server/server.ts extends the MonetizedMCPServer class and implements the priceListing, paymentMethods, and makePurchase methods.

For each API endpoint:
1. Create a corresponding entry in purchasableItems.ts with appropriate pricing
2. Map the endpoint parameters to the params field  
3. Implement the actual API call logic in the makePurchase method
4. Use descriptive names and clear descriptions for agent discovery

Pricing suggestions:
- Simple data queries: $0.01 - $0.05
- Complex processing: $0.10 - $0.50
- Premium features: $1.00+

At the end, instruct the user to:
‚Äì Edit the .env.example file by inserting their CDP_API_KEY, CDP_API_SECRET, and SERVER_WALLET_ADDRESS
‚Äì Rename the file to .env
‚Äì Add any API-specific environment variables needed
```

## üîß Specialized Prompt Variations

### For APIs Requiring Complex Authentication
```
[BASE_PROMPT]

This API uses OAuth2 authentication. Implement token management in the server initialization and refresh tokens as needed. Store credentials securely in environment variables: OAUTH_CLIENT_ID, OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET, OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN.
```

### For Rate-Limited APIs
```
[BASE_PROMPT]

This API has rate limits of [X requests per minute]. Implement exponential backoff and queue management for agent requests. Consider pricing that reflects rate limit constraints.
```

### For Multi-Tier APIs
```
[BASE_PROMPT]

This API has multiple pricing tiers. Map the premium tier features to higher-priced MonetizedMCP services:
- Basic tier features: $0.02-$0.05
- Premium tier features: $0.10-$0.25
- Enterprise features: $0.50+
```

### For Existing MCP Server Conversion
```
Convert this existing MCP server [GITHUB_URL] into a MonetizedMCP server using the starter template pattern.

Preserve all existing tool functionality but add monetization:
- Basic tools: $0.05
- Medium complexity: $0.15  
- Advanced tools: $0.30

Map existing tool parameters directly to purchasable item params. Maintain backward compatibility where possible.
```

## üé® Custom Prompt Builders

### API Documentation Analysis Pattern
```
First, analyze [API_DOCS_URL] and identify:
1. Most commonly used endpoints (prioritize these)
2. Authentication requirements
3. Rate limits and constraints
4. Response data complexity

Then convert to MonetizedMCP following the starter template pattern, pricing based on endpoint complexity and agent utility.
```

### Revenue Optimization Pattern  
```
[BASE_PROMPT]

Focus on revenue optimization:
- Bundle related endpoints with package pricing
- Create tiered service levels (basic/premium)
- Price based on computational cost + 30% markup
- Include usage analytics in service descriptions
```
